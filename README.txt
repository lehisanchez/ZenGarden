Group 7: Lehi Sanchez and Sylvie Dorsett


Walkthrough:

All related CSS has been extracted to their own file. (Typography, Animations, etc)

The main.scss includes sass partials in the following order:

@use 'reset';
@use 'typography';
@use 'colors';
@use 'layout';
@use 'rocket';
@use 'animations';


FYI !!!!!!!!!   MEDIA QUERIES !!!!!!!
To keep things organized, each file has its own Media Queries at the bottom.
